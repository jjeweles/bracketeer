# Bracket & Side Games Implementation - Improvements Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Issues Addressed

### 1. Modal Sizing & Readability
**Problem**: Bracket manager modal was hard to read and cramped
**Solution**: 
- Changed modal size from `xl` to `full` for maximum viewport usage
- Updated Modal component to support proper size variants (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `full`)
- Improved bracket card layout with larger, more readable text and better spacing
- Changed bracket grid from 8 columns to 4 columns with 2 rows for better readability

### 2. Navigation Bar Overcrowding
**Problem**: Top bar with all side game tabs stretched too far right
**Solution**:
- Replaced horizontal tab bar with a dropdown selector
- Added game number selection for eliminator in a separate section
- Cleaner, more organized navigation that scales with screen size
- Improved information density with counts in dropdown options

### 3. Score Entry Location
**Problem**: Score entry was hidden inside bracket modal
**Solution**:
- Created new `SessionScoreManager` component on main session page
- Added "Enter Scores" toggle button in session header
- Scores entered as scratch values with real-time handicap calculation display
- Visual confirmation showing both scratch score and handicap-adjusted score
- Improved workflow - no need to navigate to bracket modal for score entry

### 4. Bracket Progression System
**Problem**: No way to advance brackets after score entry
**Solution**:
- Added "Refresh Brackets" button to process completed brackets
- Created `progressBrackets` API function to determine winners and advance brackets
- Automatic calculation of winners based on total scores (+ handicap for handicap brackets)
- Updates bracket status to "completed" and records winner/runner-up
- Clear feedback to user when brackets are progressed

### 5. Print View Size
**Problem**: Printable brackets opened in small, hard-to-read modal
**Solution**:
- Enlarged all text sizes in print view (headers, player names, scores)
