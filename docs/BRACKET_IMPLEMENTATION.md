## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Create Database Collections
1. Start the application: `npm run dev`
2. Open PocketBase admin: http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/
3. Create the 3 collections above with exact field specifications

### Step 2: Basic Bracket Testing
1. Create a new session from the dashboard
2. Add exactly 8 bowlers with scratch brackets (1 or more each)
3. Click "Manage Brackets" in the session
4. Click "Generate Brackets" - should succeed
5. Verify bracket shows 8 bowlers in positions 1-8

### Step 3: Score Entry Testing
1. In the bracket view, click "Add Scores"
2. Enter scores for all bowlers (Game 1, 2, 3)
3. Verify totals calculate automatically
4. Save scores and verify they persist

### Step 4: Print Testing
1. In bracket view, click "Print View"
2. Click "Print" to test print layout
3. Verify tournament bracket structure displays correctly

### Step 5: Side Games Testing
1. Add bowlers with High Game Scratch/Handicap checked
2. Add bowlers with Eliminator checked
3. Use "Manage Brackets" to view side game tabs
4. Test eliminator cutoff calculation

### Step 6: Edge Case Testing
1. Try generating brackets with 7 bowlers (should fail with helpful message)
2. Try generating brackets with 9 bowlers (should fail, need 15 total)
3. Try generating with 16 bowlers (should create 2 brackets)

## 🔧 Business Logic

### Bracket Generation Rules
- **Minimum**: 8 bowlers required
- **Maximum**: Unlimited (creates multiple brackets)
- **Validation**: Must be exact multiples of 8
- **Distribution**: Random assignment to ensure fairness
- **Uniqueness**: Each bowler appears in only one bracket per type

### Eliminator Rules
- **Cutoff Calculation**: Average of all active bowlers' scores
- **Elimination**: Bowlers below cutoff are eliminated
- **Progression**: Only non-eliminated bowlers count in next game's average
- **Games**: Tracks eliminations across 3 games

### Side Game Rules
- **High Game Scratch**: Highest raw score wins
- **High Game Handicap**: Highest score + handicap wins
- **Eliminator**: Progressive elimination tournament

## 🚀 Usage Flow

1. **Session Setup**: Create session with pricing and handicap settings
2. **Bowler Entry**: Add bowlers with bracket and side game selections
3. **Bracket Generation**: Click "Manage Brackets" → Generate when ≥8 bowlers
4. **Score Entry**: Add scores after each game (1, 2, 3)
5. **Eliminator Management**: Calculate cutoffs and eliminate bowlers
6. **Print/Export**: Generate printable bracket documents

## 🎨 UI Features

- **Tabbed Interface**: Switch between bracket types and side games
- **Real-time Validation**: Shows exactly how many more bowlers needed
- **Live Counting**: Displays bowler counts in each category
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid operations
- **Print Optimization**: Professional bracket layout with print CSS

## 🔄 Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for production use. Future enhancements could include:

- **Bracket Progression**: Automatic advancement to semi-finals and finals
- **Payout Calculations**: Automated prize distribution
- **Tournament History**: Archive completed tournaments
- **Team Brackets**: Support for team-based tournaments

All core functionality for bracket creation and side games is now fully operational!
